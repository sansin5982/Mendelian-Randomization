# Mendelian Randomization (MR)

In **observational studies**, it’s often difficult to determine whether
a risk factor actually causes a disease, because:

-   **Confounding**: Other hidden factors may influence both the risk
    factor and the disease.

-   **Reverse causation**: The disease might actually influence the risk
    factor, not the other way around.

**Mendelian Randomization** uses genetic variants as **natural tools**
(instruments) to help determine whether an observed association between
a risk factor and an outcome is likely to be **causal**—not just
correlated.

Since genetic variants are randomly assigned at conception (like in a
randomized trial), MR helps **mimic the conditions of a randomized
controlled trial (RCT)** using observational data.
