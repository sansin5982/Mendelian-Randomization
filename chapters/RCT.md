# Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)

**Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)** are considered the **gold
standard** for finding out whether one thing **really causes** another —
like whether a drug **prevents** heart disease or whether quitting
smoking improves lung function.

Imagine we are testing a new medicine.

We **randomly split people** into two groups:

-   One group gets the **real medicine**
-   The other gets a **fake pill** (placebo)

Because the groups are **random**, they are likely **similar in every
other way** — age, lifestyle, income, etc.

So, if there’s a difference in health outcomes, it’s likely **caused by
the medicine** — not some other factor.

### RCTs aren’t always possible

Let’s look at **why RCTs aren’t always practical or ethical**,
especially when studying **risk factors** (not drugs), and how
**Mendelian Randomization (MR) **helps fill the gap.

### 1. Not ethically possible for harmful exposures

We **can’t do an RCT** to test something **harmful**, like:

> “Does smoking cause cancer?” “Does exposure to a toxic chemical affect
> pregnancy?”

We **can’t randomly assign people** to smoke or drink toxins — that
would be dangerous and unethical.

#### MR solution:

We can use genetic variants related to **nicotine metabolism** or
**alcohol tolerance** as \*natural randomizers** to study effects
**without exposing people to harm\*\*.

### 2. RCTs are expensive and require huge effort

Running an RCT needs:

-   Thousands of volunteers
-   Hospitals, labs, and long follow-up
-   Money and time — often **millions of dollars and many years**

#### MR solution:

MR can be done using **existing genetic data** from big biobanks and
studies, making it faster and cheaper.

### 3. Impractical for diseases that develop slowly

We can’t easily do an RCT that runs for **30–40** years to see if a
vitamin prevents cancer in old age. People drop out, the world changes,
and the cost becomes too high.

#### MR solution:

Because our **genes are fixed at birth**, MR gives a kind of **lifetime
exposure effect** — helping estimate the long-term causal impact without
waiting decades.

### 4. RCTs should only be used when there’s strong observational evidence

We shouldn’t jump into an RCT unless **previous data strongly suggests**
that something might work. Otherwise, you risk wasting time, money, and
exposing people to unnecessary risks.

#### MR solution:

MR can act as a **filter** — helping decide which risk factors are
**likely to be causal** and **worth testing further in RCTs**.

#### Summary

-   **RCTs** are powerful, but not always possible — especially for
    harmful exposures, long-term outcomes, or rare diseases.

-   **Mendelian Randomization** (MR) uses our **genetic code as a
    natural experiment**, offering an ethical, low-cost, and faster
    alternative for studying **causal relationships**.

-   MR doesn’t replace RCTs — but helps **prioritize what’s worth
    testing** in one.
