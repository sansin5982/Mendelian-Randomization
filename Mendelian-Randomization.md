# Mendelian Randomization

## 1. Introduction

**Mendelian Randomization (MR)** is an analytical approach that
leverages genetic variants as **instrumental variables** to **infer
causal relationship between exposure (e.g., lifestyle factor or
biomarker) and an outcome (e.g., disease risk)**. If there is a cusal
relationship between two variables it also **estimate magnitude of
causal effect**. MR is based on the principle that genetic variants are
randomlly allocated at conception and are thus **less likely to
influenced by confounding factors** or **reverse causation**, which are
common issues in observationals studies.
